# This is MATLab Resilience Project

## MATLab Resilience Project
This is a MATLab Resilience Project that I created using MATLab. This project is really good if you wanted to use it for a college project, if your university was using MATlab for Physics. You can clone this project if you are interested. FYI, every text that are displayed was using Indonesian, so you have to translate that to English if you're not from Indonesia, but it's a good start for your project.
